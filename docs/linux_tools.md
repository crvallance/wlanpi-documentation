# Linux Tools
These tools/services come preinstalled on the WLAN Pi.  Many of these are running as underlying services or dependencies so there might not be any interaction with them but are listed here for reference.  

## Tshark
TShark is a network protocol analyzer. It lets the user capture packet data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the standard output or writing the packets to a file. TShark's native capture file format is pcapng format, which is also the format used by wireshark and various other tools.

Without any options set, TShark will work much like tcpdump. It will use the pcap library to capture traffic from the first available network interface and displays a summary line on the standard output for each received packet.

## tcpdump
Tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer that prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network interface that match the boolean expression.

## iperf3
iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6).

## isc-dhcp
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server, dhcpd, implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). DHCP allows hosts on a TCP/IP network to request and be assigned IP addresses, and also to discover information about the network to which they are attached.
